# Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman, a classic word-guessing game brought to life with Python and Flask! This project aims to provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for players of all ages.

## Overview

The Hangman game application is designed to be a modern adaptation of the traditional pen-and-paper game. Users can enjoy the challenge of guessing words within a limited number of tries, all within a sleek and intuitive web interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Word Selection:** Each game session begins with the selection of a random word from a predefined list, ensuring a unique and engaging experience with every playthrough.
- **Intuitive Interface:** The client-side interface is designed using HTML and CSS, providing users with a seamless and visually appealing gaming experience.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can input their guesses via an intuitive form submission mechanism, with the server-side logic handling input validation and game state management.
- **Realistic Hangman Display:** ASCII art is used to dynamically display the progression of the Hangman figure based on the number of incorrect guesses, adding a touch of realism to the gameplay.
- **Win/Lose Conditions:** The game features comprehensive win/lose conditions, ensuring that players are appropriately rewarded for successful guesses or challenged to try again after exceeding the maximum number of attempts.
